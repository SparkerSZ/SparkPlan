# SparkPlan

Since the dawn of civilization, human race has searched endlessly for fulfillment of mind and body. This project aims to solve these foundamental problems and offer a bit fun to this ultimately boring life. 
自人类文明起源，人类一直在不停得寻找精神和身体的意义和满足感。这个火种🔥计划是我们去尝试解决这些最核心问题和给这个无聊的生命找寻一丝快乐。

We play what we build, we take pride on what we are. At end of the day, we die with legacy to the human race.

The plan is staged with 4 phases :

Phase 1 - Athena 雅典娜     Intellectual game to find the one thing that takes you through the day   
Phase 2 - Poseidon 波塞冬   A gentle wave game to touch you like a summer breeze   
Phase 3 - Hermes 赫耳墨斯   A messager to connect you with the others creatures in this universe
Phase 4 - Hades 哈迪斯      Dark Intelligence to get you the guilty pleasure of getting the secretes  
Phase 5 - Zeus  宙斯        All encompass
